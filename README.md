# Password-authenticator-in-node.js
i have made a password authenticator using express which has both frontend and backend 
The program takes credentials while signup and generate jwt token 
which then verified during signin 
and it also shows the credentials if you click "my details"
then you can logout that will delete those credentials and the token stored in the local storage os of the browser
